=== Scan configuration
[[scan-config-about]]
Sometimes it is necessary to provide special scan configuration setup, e.g. when
initializing scan operations at server side.

This can be done by a special scan configuration which is defined as JSON.

[NOTE]
====
Do not confuse with `SecHub configuration` which is always on client side. 
====

==== General
===== Name pattern ID providers
Currently only `namePatternIdProviders` are provided, which contain an id and mappings from name patterns
to identifiers. By this very generic approach dedicated adapters can fetch identifiers for specific name setups. 

==== Mapping
Scan configuration can be changed by {sechub} `mapping` - look at <<mapping-technical-details, mapping>> for more information.

NOTE: Just use the `provider` ID as mapping ID.

===== Technical details

*Usage*

A caller can use the `ScanConfigService` to fetch an `NamePatternIdprovider` which is able to provide
an ID for a given name. This is a very generic approach and callers must only use unique IDs to 
have dedicated, name based id mappings.

An ID can be any string. Given regular expressions are handled by https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html[JAVA regular expression Pattern] 


*Cluster handling*
Synchronization inside cluster is done over database and a special scheduler service:
`ScanConfigRefreshTriggerService` . This servcie checks periodically if current `scan configuration`
has been changed by administrators. If so the name pattern provider will be rebuild.

*About old JSON setup*

Before introducing <<concept-mapping,mapping concept>> we had to define scan config by JSON directly
inside a environment property on startup - but this is no longer necessary.

Here an example of former style:
[[scan-config-namepatternidprovider-example1]]
[source, json]

include::scan_config_namepattern_provider_example1.json[]

==== Checkmarx
===== Project creation with dedicated checkmarx preset and team
When a user starts a scan and a `checkmarx` project does not already exist, it will be created.
So far so good.

But maybe it is shall not be created with the default Checkmarx "preset" because in some scenarios this is not very suitable
- e.g. when creating many projects, we do not want to assign all presetIds manually to the project.
(A preset is something like a profile in Checkmarx where scope of scan can be defined at project level).

Also there should be an automated assignment to dedicated teams when
the project is new created.
 
This can be done by name pattern providers `checkmarx.newproject.presetid` and `checkmarx.newproject.teamid`
as shown in following example:

*An example scan configuration:*

Define mapping with `checkmarx.newproject.presetid`
[[scan-config-example1-checkmarx]]
[source, json]
----
include::scan_config_example1_checkmarx-preset-id.json[]
----
Define mapping with `checkmarx.newproject.teamid`
[[scan-config-example2-checkmarx]]
[source, json]
----
include::scan_config_example2_checkmarx-team-id.json[]
----

On lazy project creation time, depending on project name in sechub, after checkmarx project creation the project will automatically be assigned to the pattern specific presetId.

*For example:*

* project named in sechub with `my-java-project-marvelous1` will have preset id `100021` and will have teamId `e2e4e8f4-ba17-453b-b194-c736c605700d`.
* project named in sechub with `a-go-project-super-cli` will have preset id `100031` and will have teamId `e2e4e8f4-ba17-453b-b194-d836c605700d`.
* project named in sechub with `something-else`will have preset id `100001` and teamId `f2c4g8f4-ba17-453b-b194-c746c605700d`

[IMPORTANT]
====
First matching part will be used! So ordering is important!

====== Technical details
Checkmarx install setup does use the `ScanConfigService` to provide `presetId` and `teamId` to adapter.
Adapter will use `presetId` (if defined) and `teamId` _(mandatory as before)_ when project creation is necessary

===== How to obtain preset id
Unfortunately the preset ID is necessary for REST calls, but not
visible at Checkmarx UI.

You can either directly access the DB or inspect the web page by
web tools in you browser (e.g. enable network monitoring and change prest at UI...)  

===== How to obtain team id
Unfortunately the team ID is necessary for REST calls, but not
visible at Checkmarx UI.

You can either directly access the DB or inspect the web page by
web tools in you browser (e.g. enable network monitoring and change team at UI...)
