==== Domain Message Bus
The domain message bus represents an abstraction layer for communication between different domains.
It shall be the ONLY way to communicate between the different domains.
Purpose: In future maybe the domains will be separate spring boot applications and be also
autark deployable!

Currently SecHub contains of ONE deployable spring boot application.
But to prevent the "Big ball of mud" this abstraction must be always used when
one domain calls another one.
