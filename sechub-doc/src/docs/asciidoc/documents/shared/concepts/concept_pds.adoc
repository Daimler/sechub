=== Product delegation server

==== General
There are many open source clients available having no server component inside so lacking:

- REST access
- queing
- status requests
- scalable
- â€¦ more 

So when we want to adapt them in {sechub} style _(the product does the work and we ask for result)_ we 
need to provide a `ProductDelegationServer` (in short form `PDS`).

`PDS` is

- a spring boot application which uses a network DB for providing cluster possibility
- a complete standalone application without runtime dependencies to sechub server (or its shared kernel)
- provides REST access
- a very simple priviledge model with just two users (`tech user` + `admin user`), 
  basic auth via `TLS`, credentials are simply defined by environment entries on startup
- provides jobs, queing, monitoring etc.
- can execute single files (e.g. a bash script), where job parameters are
  available as environment variables at runtime 
- a standard way to integrate any product into {sechub} in a scalable and easy way 

==== Handling of resources
- PDS server provides `auto unzipping` of uploaded resources when configured  - see <<section-pds-server-config-file,PDS server configuration file>>
- When a PDS job fails or is done the resources inside job workspace location are *automatically removed*

==== SecHub integration
===== Executors and Adapters
====== Executors
With `PDS` there is a default `REST` `API` available. 

For different scanTypyes there will be dedicated PDSExecutors 
(`PDSWebScanExecutor`, `PDSInfraScanExecutor`, etc., etc.)

====== Adapters
The Adapter will always be the same, but filled with other necessary parameters.

NOTE: So there will be no need to write any adapter or executor when using PDS! 


=== HowTo integrate a new product via PDS

Having new security product XYZ but being a command line tool, we 


- create an environment (e.g. a docker container) where all your needed parts are integrated. 
  E.g. bash shell, tools, the product and its dependencies etc.

- create an executable starter script (e.g. bash) which
  * calls the product
  * does system out/err to standard pipes    
  * writes the product result report to relative path `./output/result.txt`

- create a `PSD` configuration file and fill with necessary data, see <<section-pds-server-config-file,PDS server configuration file>> 
 
- start wanted amount of `ProductDelegationServer` instances with dedicated configuration 
  setup to have a clustered, server ready execution of CLI security products. If you want your
  PDS to be started inside a cluster you have to setup load balancing etc. by your own. 
  For example: When using Kubernetes you normally would do this by just defining a 
  `Service` pointing to your `PODs`.
  
- test via developer admin UI if the servers are working:
  * create test job, remember PDS job uuid
  * upload data
  * mark job as ready to start
  * check job state
  * fetch result and inspect

- when former test was successful
  * Define executor at sechub server side - *will be implemented with #148*
  * When your product uses sereco general report format your are done- *will be implemented with #283* 
    otherwise SERECO must have a logic to import custom format for the PRODUCT - means needs an
    implementatiion
    
- test via sechub client by start a new sechub job which shall use the product and verify results
    

[WARNING]
====
*#148 and #283 are not implemented at the moment (07/2020)*, so PDS is currently 
working autonomous, but not integrated into sechub execution / scan processes!
