We do currently not use Hystrix or another framework to handle resilience,
but use a simple own approach:

A resilient action executor can be used to execute a dedicated
action. Implementation of `ResilienctConsultant` will give
dedicated proposals how to handle an error.

There are currently two different ways:

- Retry +
  In this case the failed action will be retried some times
  before the exception is thrown
- Fall through +
  Here the failure is recognized as a situation which will be
  happen very often because a fix will take some time and so
  to fail fast for a given time period instead of blocking
