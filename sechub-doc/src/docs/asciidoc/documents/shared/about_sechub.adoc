**About {sechub}**

{sechub} is an acronym for `Security Hub` and is first of
all *one API to scan for different security problems*. Users of {sechub} do not
care about which exact product is doing the real scan on server side, but only
configure their wanted aim.

[IMPORTANT]
====
{sechub} does *NOT* provide a security infrastructure but does orchestrate
different security products/tools.

So *you still need an existing security infrastructure* behind {sechub} !
====



It was designed to be very easy to integrate into any existing
build pipeline / contionus integration (CI) and helps to provide
**SecDevOps**.
