==== General configuration
{sechub} can be configured  by keys on server startup.
Using the spring `@Value` annotation we are able to
use these keys as Java system properties but also as environment entries.

E.g. a key like `sechub.server.baseurl` can be set with

----
java ... -Dsechub.server.baseurl=https://sechub.example.org
----

or with an environment entry `SECHUB_SERVER_BASEURL` which
is e.g. more suitable for a `kubernetes` cluster deployment.

The next text blocks describe the keys available on {sechub}:
