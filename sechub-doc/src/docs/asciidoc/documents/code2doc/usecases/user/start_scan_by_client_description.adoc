Sechub has got it's own client, written in go. The client is available for Linux and
Windows and can be downloaded at {projectSite} .

The client encapsulated and simplifies the necessary steps to do a scan to one single step only

It does automate following usecases:

.  <<sechub-doclink-uc-user-creates-job, Create a job>>
.  <<sechub-doclink-uc-user-uploads-sourcecode-for-job, Upload sources if necessary>>
.  <<sechub-doclink-uc-user-approves-job, Approve the job>>
.  <<sechub-doclink-uc-user-checks-job-state, Check job has finished>> periodically
.  <<sechub-doclink-uc-user-downloads-job-report, Download scan report>>

If the scan report traffic light is RED the build client will return an System exit code greater than zero so
build will break.

More information about the client can be found inside the user documentation.
