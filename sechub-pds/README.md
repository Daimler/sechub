# About this project
SecHub PDS stands for sechub product delegation server.

## What does PDS mean?
In a nutshell: A common generic server to easily integrate CLI tools into sechub.

For details please look into documenation at https://daimler.github.io/sechub/

## Why is there no dependency to shared kernel or other sechub parts?
PDS is a complete standalone application/server and shall have no dependency to sechub itself.

Documentation is done inside sechub-doc as usual, but we haveno usecase annotations etc. This is
only for sechub server parts available. To provide usecase information this must be done oldschool 
by writing manual.
